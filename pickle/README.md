### How To Build

Currently does not support other options like Make or CMake, hopefully that will be added soon
However, SCons will handle the entire build automation flow

1. Install SCons from their website https://scons.org/pages/download.html
2. Install JAVA JDK from their website http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html
    - Add the JDK bin path to your environment path
3. Set up the paths in the build scripts : `$JAVA_JDK_PATH` `$ANTLR_JAR_PATH`
4. Run `scons.py` from the directory that contains `SConstruct`

### How To Generate The Parse Tree

1. Run the `build.sh` script
2. Use the optional command line arguments for a different grammar file or a different sample program

### ANTLR Runtime

The runtime library has already been compiled into a static library for easy linking, no need to worry about the runtime source files
